                        Hello! My name is Devin and I am currently a third year student at UC Davis majoring in computer science. I have experience building front-end web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and much more! I am proficient in other programming languages such as Python and C++ too. In school, I've taken courses in Object Oriented Programming, Algorithm Analysis, and Computer Architecture,
                        and by this summer I will have completed more Web Development courses focusing on topics such as ReactJS, SQL, and Node.js.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Outside of my studies I love to play music, rock climb, spend time in nature, and volunteer at the school radio station. I also believe that mindfulness is a key tenet to lead a successful life in and out of the workplace, so I make sure to spend time developing my physical and mental health through yoga, exercise, and meditation.
